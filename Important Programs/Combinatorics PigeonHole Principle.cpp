/* Also known as Dirichlet Box Principle*/

// Maximum Subsequence Value

/* Given an array of M integers and an integer N (N < M), Prove that there always exists a pair 
such that their difference is divisible by N */
// Holes = elements of residue class {0,1,2,3,4,....,N-1}
// Pigeons = M integers

/*Pigeonhole principle states that : if there are N hole and N+1 pigeons, the atleast 1 hole will have 1 or more principle*/
